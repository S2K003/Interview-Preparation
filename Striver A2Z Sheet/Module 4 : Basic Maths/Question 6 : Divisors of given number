"""
Given an integer N, print all the divisors of N in the ascending order.
Example 1:
Input : 20
Output: 1 2 4 5 10 20
Explanation: 20 is completely 
divisible by 1, 2, 4, 5, 10 and 20.
Example 2:
Input: 21191
Output: 1 21191
Explanation: As 21191 is a prime number,
it has only 2 factors(1 and the number itself).
